# flappy-game-part-two
A game built after finishing the _nology course, in an attempt to improve the original 'flappy game' produced in game week (week 5) at _nology. It is an attempt to recreate flappy bird.

Original game can be found [here](https://github.com/AnnikaChauhan/flappy-game).

The game was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and does not need any additional packages to be run locally.

Access to the live game is available [here](https://annikachauhan.github.io/flappy-game-part-two/).
